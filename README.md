### Description

### Task 1: Array Manipulation
**File**: `arrayManipulation.js`
- **Function**: `processArray`
  - **Description**: This file named arrayManipulation takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.
  


### Task 2: String Formatting

  - **Description**: In arrayManipulation, a function `formatArrayStrings`is added which takes two arrays as argumentsâ€”an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. The function modifies each string based on its corresponding number; capitalizes the entire string if the number is even, and converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd.
  

### Task 3: User Profile Creation

  - **Description**: A file named `userInfo.js` is created. A fuction `createUserProfiles` takes an array of names and an array of modified names from `arrayManipulation.js`. It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
